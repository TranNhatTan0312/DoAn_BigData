Anderson asked the man if he had a cigarette, but he kept walking until he suddenly stopped, turned around, pulled out a gun and shot two .32 caliber bullets into Anderson.  As Anderson collapsed to the ground, the man shot Terry White three times.  Both boys were seriously injured, but survived the attack.  Manuel Moore was charged with assault with a deadly weapon for shooting Anderson and White.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

Shields IV, was accompanying a friend to 231 Vernon Street in the Ingleside district in San Francisco, California in the United States, at about 9:30pm, where the two were picking up a rug Shields' friend was buying from a rug dealer's home.  As Shields was rearranging items in the back of the station wagon to make room for the rug, he was shot three times in the back with a .32 caliber gun.  Although no indictments were brought on this crime other than the charge of conspiracy, authorities believe that witness descriptions of the perpetrator(s)  as could have matched either of three of the Zebra killers.  Additionally, just before Shields and his friend arrived at the rug dealer's home, the rug dealer noticed two African American men in their twenties parked in a car outside her home, but by the time Shields and his friend arrived, the men were gone.

Officer Wayne Rhatigan, a member of the New York Police Department's mounted division, was alerted by the vendor and then approached the vehicle and looked inside, where he spotted a box that was smoking and was able to smell gunpowder. The NYPD Bomb Squad was called to the scene, where they deployed a robotic device to break the SUV's back windows and to observe what was inside the vehicle. In the vehicle, police discovered the following: three 20-gallon propane canisters; two five-gallon cans of gasoline; 40+ consumer-grade M-88 firecrackers that had been placed inside of a 20-ounce metal container that had been wrapped in duct tape; a 55-inch by 32-inch green metal locker that contained eight plastic bags that held a total of approximately 250 pounds of Urea based fertilizer, a metal pressure cooker pot containing wires and an additional 120 M-88 firecrackers.
